Various constitutional, legislative and comparative legal precedents, from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, India and New Zealand, were cited to support the petition, stating that “the Paraná Delta lives, breathes, develops, pulses, feels. Our petition goes beyond the demand of the right to live in a healthy environment, it goes beyond the right to a healthy environment of the citizens who inhabit these territories, it goes beyond the ailments that affect us in our environment, our life, our health, the Delta has its own life and it is succumbing.
