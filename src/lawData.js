                <p className='mb-6 timeline-p'>2022  On 20 June, an application was lodged in the High Court of South Africa in the Gauteng Division, Pretoria, to release three Elephants - known as Lammie, Mopane and Ramadiba - from the Johannesburg Zoo so they live the remainder of their lives in a natural environment. Leading global Elephant experts have attested that they are highly intelligent, socially complex and sentient beings who are living in conditions that are adverse to their well-being, and are as a result in a state of distress. The conditions offered by the Johannesburg Zoo do not meet their fundamental physical, mental and emotional needs. See Press Release.
