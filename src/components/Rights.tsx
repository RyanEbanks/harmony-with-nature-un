            <h1>Rights of Nature Law and Policy</h1>
            <p>The law has seen the beginning of an evolution toward recognition of 
                the inherent rights of Nature to exist, thrive and evolve. This 
                evolving legal approach acknowledges that the traditional 
                environmental regulatory systems generally described herein regard 
                nature as property to be used for human benefit, rather than a 
                rights-bearing partner with which humanity has co-evolved. Rights 
                of Nature is grounded in the recognition that humankind and Nature 
                share a fundamental, non-anthropocentric relationship given our 
                shared existence on this planet, and it creates guidance for 
                actions that respect this relationship. Legal provisions 
                recognizing the Rights of Nature, sometimes referred to as Earth 
                Jurisprudence, include constitutions, national statutes, and local 
                laws. In addition, new policies, guidelines and resolutions are 
                increasingly pointing to the need for a legal approach that 
                recognizes the rights of the Earth to well-being. Furthermore, 
                educational activities on the rights of Nature are on the increase 
                in the professional and public spheres to advance Earth 
                Jurisprudence worldwide.</p>
